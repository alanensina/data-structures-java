# Stack

**Stack** is a data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle.

This means that the last item added to the stack is the first one to be removedâ€”kind of like a stack of plates or books: you put new ones on top, and you take the top one off first.

## Key Operations:
- Push: Add an item to the top of the stack.

- Pop: Remove the top item from the stack.

- Peek (or Top): View the top item without removing it.

- IsEmpty: Check if the stack has no elements.

## Real-world Analogies:
- A stack of dishes.

- Undo functionality in applications.

- Backtracking (e.g., in maze-solving or navigating back in a web browser).

## Uses in Computing:
- Function calls and recursion (the call stack).

- Expression evaluation (e.g., converting infix to postfix).

- Syntax parsing.

- Backtracking algorithms.
